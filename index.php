	<h1>About Me</h1>
	
	<p>My name is Brent Smith. I am a senior, with this being my last semester at BYU-Idaho. I will be graduating this December with my undergrad in Web Design and Development. My technical background is simply from the courses here at BYU-Idaho with some work experience. I have taken ENG 321, CIT 230, CIT 336, CIT 225, CS 371, and CIT 370. From each of these courses I have enjoyed learning about the overall design of websites in every aspect. I currently work as a web content manager for a consulting form. In this position I have the opportunity to go through the content on the website to make the readability of the site more professional and a more consistent smooth flow. I love creating and working on websites, more along the lines of front end design. I would love to own my own business helping companies develop a successful web presence.</p>
	<p>I have been married for just over two years. My wife and I recently celebrated our second anniversary by going to Park City for the day. We have a six-month-old boy. His name is Boston. We enjoy being parents and are proud to say our son is starting to sleep through the night. There is nothing better than 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep.</p>
